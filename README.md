# SAR-based Landslide rapid Assessment (SAR-LRA) Tool
In this repository, we present a practical, all-weather, day-night SAR-based Landslide Rapid Assessment tool (SAR-LRA). This tool is based on Deep Neural Networks and it's designed for landslide detection during earthquake-triggered multiple landslide events.
