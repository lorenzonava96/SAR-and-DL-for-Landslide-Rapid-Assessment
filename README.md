# SAR-based Landslide Rapid Assessment (SAR-LRA) Tool
In this repository, we introduce a practical, all-weather, day-night SAR-based Landslide Rapid Assessment tool (SAR-LRA). Utilizing Deep Neural Networks (DNN), this tool is tailored for landslide detection during earthquake-triggered multiple landslide events (MLEs). For further details, please consult the preprint "Sentinel-1 SAR-based Globally Distributed Landslide Detection by Deep Neural Networks" by [Nava et al (2024)](link).

The repository provides files enabling the deployment of DNNs trained on Sentinel-1 Ascending and Descending orbits separately within a specified area. The code utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) to acquire and process satellite imagery and deploys the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on your local machine.

Please note that this tool is currently in its beta version and will undergo continuous improvement as new inventories become available. Additionally, we aim to expand its functionality to include rainfall-induced multiple landslide events in the future.
